# ECE 445: Senior Design Laboratory Lab Notebook - Jack Arndt (jrarndt2)
# February 8th, 2022
## Initial Meeting with TA
### Notes from meeting
* Add additional hardware components to increase project complexity
 * Consider replacing original proposed DC power supply adapter with a rechargable battery (Lithium-Ion?)
	* This would require additional circuitry to monitor the battery's state and regulate voltage output to other subsystems
* ESD protection?
* Add an LCD display to display additional information about the game (e.g. dealer instructions, battery levels, etc.)
* Keep working on Project Proposal document
* Start to think about lower-level requirements necessary for each subsystem
### Brainstorming
* Card identification?
 * Light sensors
 * QR codes
 * RFID tags
### High-Level Requirements
* The RFID Sensor must be able to sense and distinguish the 52 different RFID tags associated with each card and provide the card ID signal to the microprocessor
* The microprocessor must be able to receive a card ID value and send this value to the iOS App via bluetooth packet.
* The iOS App must be able to receive card ID info via a bluetooth packet and use the currently played cards to determine an optimal move for the player.
### Additional thoughts to consider
* Progamming langauge to construct phone app?
* Texas Hold'em Poker and Blackjack mathematical analysis to start thinking about psuedo-code for the app
* Define what information will be displayed/hidden to the user
